I'm interested in taking DATA 602, because I believe it builds a crucial foundation for my journey ahead. I want to develop a focused understanding of the core concepts, tools, and methodologies that leads data science today. This subject will help me build a strong base in areas like data wrangling, statistical analysis, and machine learning, which are very important for more advanced topics and research.
